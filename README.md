# Market Stock Simulator
Open source JavaFX application that simulates market stock in a very simplified way.
I created it during my IT studies before I learnt how to efficiently use git and GitHub. 

I'm uploading it now to show possible recruiters my accomplishments.

## Quick start
**NOTE: You need to have Java (version 1.8) installed and available from command line!**

Go to [releases](https://github.com/dominieq/market-stock/releases) 
and choose your version of Market Stock Simulator.
Once you've downloaded the application, run it by using the following command:
````
java -jar marketstock-{latest_version}-fat.jar
````

## Build application from scratch
**NOTE: You need to have Maven (version at least 3.3.1) installed and available from command line!**

To build application on your own, first download or copy
the source code and then go to the project folder and execute:
````
mvn clean package
````
